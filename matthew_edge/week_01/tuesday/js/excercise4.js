/* FixStart

Create a function called fixStart. It should take a single argument, a string, and return a version where all occurences of its first character have been replaced with '*', except for the first character itself. You can assume that the string is at least one character long. For example:

fixStart('babble'): 'ba**le'
*/

var fixStart = function (){

}


//split input string into an array.
